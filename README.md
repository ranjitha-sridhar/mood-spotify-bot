🎵 Mood-Based Spotify Player
A dynamic, mood-driven music player that recommends and plays Spotify playlists based on your current mood! Type in how you feel, and the app will serve the perfect playlist — from relaxing and chill vibes to energetic workout tracks, Bollywood hits, or even a fun “bored” playlist.
This project is built with Python Flask, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and uses Spotify Embed Player for smooth playback. The app also dynamically changes UI colors and background gradients to match the selected mood, creating an immersive, responsive experience.

🎶 Mood Detection: Enter your mood (happy, sad, energetic, relaxed, Bollywood, bored, etc.) to get a matching playlist.
🎧 Direct Spotify Playback: Play songs directly in your browser with an embedded Spotify player.
🌈 Dynamic UI Colors: Accent colors and background gradients change to match your mood.
💡 Wide Mood Library: Supports moods like happy, sad, energetic, relaxed, romantic, focus, party, chill, nostalgic, angry, sleepy, adventurous, meditative, Bollywood, bored, and more.
📱 Responsive & Smooth: Modern, mobile-friendly interface with animated transitions.

Usage
Type your mood into the input box (e.g., happy, sad, Bollywood, bored).
Click Play.
The app will display a Spotify playlist matching your mood, play it in the embedded player, and dynamically change the UI to match the vibe.
